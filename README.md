**Dataset used**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tthien/shanghaitech

## Models
We trained 3 previously researched models based on the benchmark [here](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/crowd-counting-on-shanghaitech-a), which are [CSRNet](link referensi), [Fusion-Count](), and [YOLO]()
all our models are trained using TensorFlow architecture optimized for large scale production.

- **CSRNet:** CSRNet is a model...
- **FusionCount:** Fusion count is a model that works by...
- **YOLOv8:** YOLOv8 is a model... .The yolo model can be found [here](link drive)

## Evaluation
We find that CSRNet is a better choice for implementation for reasons such as efficent storage use, and model compatibility overall, with a score of...
